# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# puts "Hello world"

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7.77

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5+2

# Strings
# puts "tacos"
#ruby is forgiving
# puts "tacos" *3 
# this does not work: 
# puts "tacos" +3

# Combine strings together
# puts "3 tacos"
# puts "#{3} tacos"
# puts "#{3+3} tacos"

# Variables
quantinty = 3 + 3 + 3
food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
# puts quantinty + food  ->error
# puts "#{quantinty} #{food}"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".upcase
# puts "Hello".reverse
# puts "Hello".swapcase
